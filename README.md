# TimedMultiplexer
     This my new beginner code written for the practice of Verilog coding and in this project I have tried to design a sequential circuit which has simiarities to the functioning of a multiplexer.
     Two one-bit data inputs are fed at twice the clock rate and the RTL module has to give out data with the individual inputs multiplexed as shown in the image.
